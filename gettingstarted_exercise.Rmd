## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
# R calls in R markdown go within sections delimited by three backticks (`, the character just to the left of the 1 on US English keyboards; YMMV on other keyboards). For R code to execute, you must include {r} after the first three.

```{r}
2+3
library(ape)
plot(rcoal(5))
```
  
# Take the following lines and do what they say
# Make this line bold
text(1, "make this line bold", font=2)

# MAKE THE WORD ITALIC ITALICIZED
text(1, "make the word italic italicized", font=3)

# MAKE THE FOLLOWING R CODE CREATE A PLOT IN THIS DOCUMENT
plot(density(rnorm(1000)))

# Edit this document so that this code all runs properly. You can create the final document by doing `rmarkdown::render("gettingstarted_exercise.Rmd")` in R or hitting the knit button in Rstudio.
# Experience with coding.
```{r}
{GetHowManyTrees <- rtree(n=10)
  plot(GetHowManyTrees, edge.width = 1)}
  
```
